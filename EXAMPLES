These are examples of classification and regression using some of the
files in the data directory.

The final column is the training value.  
For classifcation problems, the training value must be 1 or -1.
For regression problems, the training value is a floating point number.

data/5parity
Classify the parity of a 5 bit sequence.  
Note that the test range is null, as the program will find
a perfect classifier, and all 32 bit patterns are required to
do so.
